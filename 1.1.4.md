## 1.1.4 机器学习的R基础 ##

As we stated at the outset, we believe that the best way to learn a new technical skill is to start with a problem you wish to solve or a question you wish to answer. Being excited about the higher-level vision of your work makes learning from case studies effective. In this review of basic concepts in the R language, we will not be addressing a machine learning problem, but we will encounter several issues related to working with data and managing it in R. As we will see in the case studies, quite often we will spend the bulk of our time getting the data formatted and organized in a way that suits the anal- ysis. Usually very little time, in terms of coding, is spent running the analysis.

For this case we will address a question with pure entertainment value. Recently, the data service Infochimps.com released a data set with over 60,000 documented reports of unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings. The data spans hundreds of years and has reports from all over the world. Though it is international, the majority of sightings in the data come from the United States. With the time and spatial dimensions of the data, we might ask the following questions: are there seasonal trends in UFO sightings; and what, if any, variation is there among UFO sightings across the different states in the US?

This is a great data set to start exploring because it is rich, well-structured, and fun to work with. It is also useful for this exercise because it is a large text file, which is typically the type of data we will deal with in this book. In such text files there are often messy parts, and we will use base functions in R and some external libraries to clean and organize the raw data. This section will bring you through, step by step, an entire simple analysis that tries to answer the questions we posed earlier. You will find the code for this section in the code folder for this chapter in the file ufo_sightings.R. We begin by loading the data and required libraries for the analysis.

### 加载函数库及数据 ###
首先, 我们会加载 ggplot2 包, 我们将会在最后进行可视化分析的时候使用它：

    library(ggplot2)

当加载 ggplot2 的时候，你会注意到这个包同时加载了另外两个依赖包：plyr 和 reshape包。这两个包都是用来操作和组织数据的，在本例中我们将会使用plyr来收集和组织数据。

下一步是从ufo_awesome.tsv文件(在第一章的data/ufo/目录下，可以在README中找到链接)中把数据加载到R环境。
Note that the file is tab-delimited (hence the .tsv file extension), which means we will need to use the read.delim function to load the data. Because R exploits defaults very heavily, we have to be particularly conscientious of the default parameter settings for the functions we use in our scripts. To see how we can learn about parameters in R, suppose that we had never used the read.delim function before and needed to read the help files. Alternatively, assume that we do not know that read.delim exists and need to find a function to read delimited data into a data frame. R offers several useful functions for searching for help:

    ?read.delim ??base::delim
    help.search("delimited") RSiteSearch("parsing text")
    # Access a function's help file
    # Search for 'delim' in all help files for functions # in 'base'
    # Search for 'delimited' in all help files
    # Search for the term 'parsing text' on the R site.

In the first example, we append a question mark to the beginning of the function. This will open the help file for the given function, and it’s an extremely useful R shortcut. We can also search for specific terms inside of packages by using a combination of ?? and ::. The double question marks indicate a search for a specific term. In the example, we are searching for occurrences of the term “delim” in all base functions, using the double colon. R also allows you to perform less structured help searches with help.search and RSiteSearch. The help.search function will search all help files in your installed packages for some term, which in the preceding example is “delimited”. Al- ternatively, you can search the R website, which includes help files and the mailing lists archive, using the RSiteSearch function. Please note that this is by no means meant to be an exhaustive review of R or the functions used in this section. As such, we highly recommend using these search functions to explore R’s base functions on your own.
For the UFO data there are several parameters in read.delim that we will need to set by hand in order to read in the data properly. First, we need to tell the function how the data is delimited. We know this is a tab-delimited file, so we set sep to the Tab character. Next, when read.delim is reading in data, it attempts to convert each column of data into an R data type using several heuristics. In our case, all of the columns are strings, but the default setting for all read.* functions is to convert strings to factor types. This class is meant for categorical variables, but we do not want this. As such, we have to set stringsAsFactors=FALSE to prevent this. In fact, it is always a good prac- tice to switch off this default, especially when working with unfamiliar data. Also, this data does not include a column header as its first row, so we will need to switch off that default as well to force R to not use the first row in the data as a header. Finally, there are many empty elements in the data, and we want to set those to the special R value NA.
To do this, we explicitly define the empty string as the na.string: 

    ufo<-read.delim("data/ufo/ufo_awesome.tsv", sep="\t", stringsAsFactors=FALSE,header=FALSE, na.strings="")

>>The term “categorical variable” refers to a type of data that denotes an observation’s membership in category. In statistics, categorical variables are very important because we may be interested in what makes certain observations of a certain type. In R we represent categorical variables as factor types, which essentially assigns numeric references to string la- bels. In this case, we convert certain strings—such as state abbreviations —into categorical variables using as.factor, which assigns a unique numeric ID to each state abbreviation in the data set. We will repeat this process many times.

We now have a data frame containing all of the UFO data! Whenever you are working with data frames, especially when they are from external data sources, it is always a good idea to inspect the data by hand. Two great functions for doing this are head and tail. These functions will print the first and last six entries in a data frame:

    head(ufo)
    V1            V2            V3         V4        5              V6
    1 19951009 19951009     Iowa City, IA <NA>      <NA> Man repts. witnessing "flash..
    ...
    
The first obvious issue with the data frame is that the column names are generic. Using the documentation for this data set as a reference, we can assign more meaningful labels to the columns. Having meaningful column names for data frames is an important best practice. It makes your code and output easier to understand, both for you and other audiences. We will use the names function, which can either access the column labels for a data structure or assign them. From the data documentation, we construct a character vector that corresponds to the appropriate column names and pass it to the names functions with the data frame as its only argument:

    names(ufo)<-c("DateOccurred","DateReported","Location","ShortDescription", "Duration","LongDescription")

From the head output and the documentation used to create column headings, we know that the first two columns of data are dates. As in other languages, R treats dates as a special type, and we will want to convert the date strings to actual date types. To do this, we will use the as.Date function, which will take the date string and attempt to convert it to a Date object. With this data, the strings have an uncommon date format of the form YYYMMDD. As such, we will also have to specify a format string in as.Date so the function knows how to convert the strings. We begin by converting the DateOccurred column:

    ufo$DateOccurred<-as.Date(ufo$DateOccurred, format="%Y%m%d")
    Error in strptime(x, format, tz = "GMT") : input string is too long

We’ve just come upon our first error! Though a bit cryptic, the error message contains the substring “input string too long”, which indicates that some of the entries in the DateOccurred column are too long to match the format string we provided. Why might this be the case? We are dealing with a large text file, so perhaps some of the data was malformed in the original set. Assuming this is the case, those data points will not be parsed correctly when loaded by read.delim, and that would cause this sort of error. Because we are dealing with real-world data, we’ll need to do some cleaning by hand.
