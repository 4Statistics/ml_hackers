## 1.1.3 加载和安装R包 ##

There are many well-designed, -maintained, and -supported R packages related to ma- chine learning. With respect to the case studies we will describe, there are packages for dealing with spatial data, text analysis, network structures, and interacting with web- based APIs, among many others. As such, we will be relying heavily on the functionality built into several of these packages.

Loading packages in R is very straightforward. There are two functions to perform this: library and require. There are some subtle differences between the two, but for the purposes of this book, the primary difference is that require will return a Boolean (TRUE or FALSE) value, indicating whether the package is installed on the machine after attempting to load it. For example, in Chapter 6 we will use the tm package to tokenize text. To load these packages, we can use either the library or require functions. In the following example, we use library to load tm but use require for XML. By using the print function, we can see that we have XML installed because a Boolean value of TRUE was returned after the package was loaded:

    library(tm)
    print(require(XML))
    #[1] TRUE

If we did not have XML installed—i.e., if require returned FALSE—then we would need to install that package before proceeding.

>>If you are working with a fresh installation of R, then you will have to install a number of packages to complete all of the case studies in this book.

There are two ways to install packages in R: either with the GUI or with the install.packages function from the console. Given the intended audience for this book, we will be interacting with R exclusively from the console during the case studies, but it is worth pointing out how to use the GUI to install packages. From the menu bar in the application, navigate to Packages & Data→Package Installer, and a window will appear, as displayed in Figure 1-4. From the Package Repository drop-down, select either “CRAN (binaries)”or “CRAN (sources)”, and click the Get List button to load all of the packages available for installation. The most recent version of packages will be available in the “CRAN (sources)” repository, and if you have the necessary com- pilers installed on your machine, we recommend using this sources repository. You can now select the package you wish to install and click Install Selected to install the packages.

The install.packages function is the preferred way to install packages because it pro- vides greater flexibility in how and where packages get installed. One of the primary advantages of using install.packages is that it allows you to install from local source code as well as from CRAN. Though uncommon, occasionally you may want to install a package that is not yet available on CRAN—for example, if you’re updating to an experimental version of a package. In these cases you will need to install from source:

    install.packages("tm", dependencies=TRUE)
    setwd("~/Downloads/")
    install.packages("RCurl_1.5-0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")

In the first example, we use the default settings to install the tm package from CRAN. The tm provides a function used to do text mining, and we will use it in Chapter 3 to perform classifications on email text. One useful parameter in the install.packages function is suggests, which by default is set to FALSE, but if activated will instruct the function to download and install any secondary packages used by the primary instal- lation. As a best practice, we recommend always setting this to TRUE, especially if you are working with a clean installation of R.

Alternatively, we can also install directly from compressed source files. In the previous example, we installed the RCurl package from the source code available on the author’s website. Using the setwd function to make sure the R working directory is set to the directory where the source file has been saved, we can simply execute the command shown earlier to install directly from the source code. Note the two parameters that have been altered in this case. First, we must tell the function not to use one of the CRAN repositories by setting repos=NULL, and we also specify the type of installation using type="source".

As mentioned, we will use several packages through the course of this book. Table 1-2 lists all of the packages used in the case studies and includes a brief description of their purpose, along with a link to additional information about each. Given the number of prerequisite packages, to expedite the installation process we have created a short script that will check whether each required package is installed and, if it is not, will attempt to install it from CRAN. To run the script, use the setwd function to set the Working Directory to the code folder for this chapter, and execute the source command as shown here:

    source("package_installer.R")

If you have not yet done so, you may be asked to select a CRAN repository. Once set, the script will run, and you will see the progress of any required package installation that you did not yet have. We are now ready to begin exploring machine learning with R! Before we proceed to the case studies, however, we will review some R functions and operations that we will use frequently.
