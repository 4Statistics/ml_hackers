## 1.1.5 R延伸阅读 ##

This introductory case is by no means meant to be an exhaustive review of the language. Rather, we used this data set to introduce several R paradigms related to loading, cleaning, organizing, and analyzing data. We will revisit many of these functions and processes in the following chapters, along with many others. For those readers inter- ested in gaining more practice and familiarity with R before proceeding, there are many excellent resources. These resources can roughly be divided into either reference books and texts or online resources, as shown in Table 1-3.

在下一章，我们会进行一些探索性的数据分析。其实这一章的例子大多都与数据探索有关，但是我们只是比较快的浏览了一下，在下一章我们会更加仔细的研究数据探索过程。
