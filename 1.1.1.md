## 下载和安装R ##

Like many open source projects, R is distributed by a series of regional mirrors. If you do not have R already installed on your machine, the first step is to download it. Go to http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html and select the CRAN mirror closest to you. Once you have selected a mirror, you will need to download the appropriate distribution of R for whichever operating system you are running.

R relies on several legacy libraries compiled from C and Fortran. As such, depending on your operating system and your familiarity with installing software from source code, you may choose to install R from either a compiled binary distribution or the source. Next, we present instructions for installing R on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux distributions, with notes on installing from either source or binaries when avail- able.

Finally, R is available in both 32- and 64-bit versions. Depending on your hardware and operating system combination, you should install the appropriate version.

### Windows ###

For Windows operating systems, there are two subdirectories available to install R: base and contrib. The latter is a directory of compiled Windows binary versions of all of the contributed R packages in CRAN, whereas the former is the basic installation. Select the base installation, and download the latest compiled binary. Installing con- tributed packages is easy to do from R itself and is not language-specific; therefore, it is not necessary to to install anything from the contrib directory. Follow the on-screen instructions for the installation.

Once the installation has successfully completed, you will have an R application in your Start menu, which will open the RGui and R Console, as pictured in Figure 1-1.

For most standard Windows installations, this process should proceed without any issues. If you have a customized installation or encounter errors during the installation, consult the R for Windows FAQ at your mirror of choice.
