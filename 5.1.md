第5章  回归：预测PV（Page Views，页面浏览量）
=====================================

#回归

抽象来说，回归是一个很简单的概念：根据给定的数字集合，预测另一个数字集合。例如，精算师想根据人的抽烟习惯来预测他的寿命，气象学家要根据今天的气温预测明天的温度。一般来说，称给定的数字集合为输入，称预测出的数字集合为输出。有时候，人们也称输入为预测因素或特征值。

回归分析与分类统计的区别在于回归分析的结果是真实的数字。正如在[第3章][1]提到的一样，在分类统计问题中，可能是使用虚拟编码来区分种类，例如0表示ham，1表示垃圾邮件。


What makes regression different from classification is that the outputs are really num-bers. In classification problems like those we described in [Chapter 3][1], you might use
numbers as a dummy code for a categorical distinction so that 0 represents ham and 1
represents spam. But these numbers are just symbols; we’re not exploiting the “num-berness” of 0 or 1 when we use dummy variables. In regression, the essential fact about
the outputs is that they really are numbers: you want to predict things like temperatures,
which could be 50 degrees or 71 degrees. Because you’re predicting numbers, you want
to be able to make strong statements about the relationship between the inputs and the
outputs: you might want to say, for example, that when the number of packs of ciga-rettes a person smokes per day doubles, their predicted life span gets cut in half.

The problem, of course, is that wanting to make precise numerical predictions isn’t the
same thing as actually being able to make predictions. To make quantitative predic-tions, we need to come up with some rule that can leverage the information we have
access to. The various regression algorithms that statisticians have developed over the
last 200 years all provide different ways to make predictions by turning inputs into
outputs. In this chapter, we’ll cover the workhorse regression model, which is called
linear regression.
