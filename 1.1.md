## 1.1 R for Machine Learning ##

>>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics....R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time- series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly ex- tensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical method- ology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

R is an extremely powerful language for manipulating and analyzing data. Its meteoric rise in popularity within the data science and machine learning communities has made it the de facto lingua franca for analytics. R’s success in the data analysis community stems from two factors described in the preceding epitaphs: R provides most of the technical power that statisticians require built into the default language, and R has been supported by a community of statisticians who are also open source devotees.
There are many technical advantages afforded by a language designed specifically for statistical computing. As the description from the R Project notes, the language pro- vides an open source bridge to S, which contains many highly specialized statistical operations as base functions. For example, to perform a basic linear regression in R, one must simply pass the data to the lm function, which then returns an object con- taining detailed information about the regression (coefficients, standard errors, residual values, etc.). This data can then be visualized by passing the results to the plot function, which is designed to visualize the results of this analysis.
In other languages with large scientific computing communities, such as Python, du- plicating the functionality of lm requires the use of several third-party libraries to rep- resent the data (NumPy), perform the analysis (SciPy), and visualize the results (mat- plotlib). As we will see in the following chapters, such sophisticated analyses can be performed with a single line of code in R.
In addition, as in other scientific computing environments, the fundamental data type in R is a vector. Vectors can be aggregated and organized in various ways, but at the core, all data is represented this way. This relatively rigid perspective on data structures can be limiting, but is also logical given the application of the language. The most frequently used data structure in R is the data frame, which can be thought of as a matrix with attributes, an internally defined “spreadsheet” structure, or relational database-like structure in the core of the language. Fundamentally, a data frame is simply a column-wise aggregation of vectors that R affords specific functionality to, which makes it ideal for working with any manner of data.

>>For all of its power, R also has its disadvantages. R does not scale well with large data, and although there have been many efforts to address this problem, it remains a serious issue. For the purposes of the case studies we will review, however, this will not be an issue. The data sets we will use are relatively small, and all of the systems we will build are prototypes or proof-of-concept models. This distinction is important because if your intention is to build enterprise-level machine learning systems at the Google or Facebook scale, then R is not the right solution. In fact, companies like Google and Facebook often use R as their “data sandbox” to play with data and experiment with new machine learning methods. If one of those experiments bears fruit, then the engineers will attempt to replicate the functionality designed in R in a more appropri- ate language, such as C.

This ethos of experimentation has also engendered a great sense of community around the language. The social advantages of R hinge on this large and growing community of experts using and contributing to the language. As Bo Cowgill alludes to, R was borne out of statisticians’ desire to have a computing environment that met their spe- cific needs. Many R users, therefore, are experts in their various fields. This includes an extremely diverse set of disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, economics, and political science, to name a few. This community of experts has built a massive collection of packages on top of the extensive base functions in R. At the time of writing, CRAN, the R repository for packages, contained over 2,800 packages. In the case studies that follow, we will use many of the most popular packages, but this will only scratch the surface of what is possible with R.

Finally, although the latter portion of Cowgill’s statement may seem a bit menacing, it further highlights the strength of the R community. As we will see, the R language has a particularly odd syntax that is rife with coding “gotchas” that can drive away even experienced developers. But all grammatical grievances with a language can eventually be overcome, especially for persistent hackers. What is more difficult for nonstatisti- cians is the liberal assumption of familiarity with statistical and mathematical methods built into R functions. Using the lm function as an example, if you had never performed a linear regression, you would not know to look for coefficients, standard errors, or residual values in the results. Nor would you know how to interpret those results.

But because the language is open source, you are always able to look at the code of a function to see exactly what it is doing. Part of what we will attempt to accomplish with this book is to explore many of these functions in the context of machine learning, but that exploration will ultimately address only a tiny subset of what you can do in R. Fortunately, the R community is full of people willing to help you understand not only the language, but also the methods implemented in it. Table 1-1 lists some of the best places to start.

The remainder of this chapter focuses on getting you set up with R and using it. This includes downloading and installing R, as well as installing R packages. We conclude with a miniature case study that will serve as an introduction to some of the R idioms we’ll use in later chapters. This includes issues of loading, cleaning, organizing, and analyzing data.
