2.5 Numeric Summaries
=========================================


One of the best ways to start making sense of a new data set is to compute simple numeric summaries of all of the columns. R is very well suited to doing this. If you have just one column from a data set as a vector, summary will spit out the most obvious values you should look at first:

    data.file <- file.path('data', '01_heights_weights_genders.csv')
    heights.weights <- read.csv(data.file, header = TRUE, sep = ',')
    heights <- with(heights.weights, Height)
    summary(heights)
    
    # Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    #54.26   63.51   66.32   66.37   69.17   79.00

Asking for the summary of a vector of numbers from R will give you the numbers you see in the example:

1. The minimum value in the vector 
2. The first quartile (which is also called the 25th percentile and is the smallest number that’s bigger than 25% of your data)
3. The median (aka the 50th percentile)
4. The mean
5. The 3rd quartile (aka the 75th percentile)
6. The maximum value

This is close to everything you should ask for when you want a quick numeric summary of a data set. All that’s really missing is the standard deviation of the column entries, a numeric summary we’ll define later in this chapter. In the following pages, we’ll describe how to compute each of the numbers that summary produces separately, and then we’ll show you how to interpret them.
