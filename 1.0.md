第一章 使用R
=================

Machine learning exists at the intersection of traditional mathematics and statistics with software engineering and computer science. In this book, we will describe several tools from traditional statistics that allow you to make sense of the world. Statistics has almost always been concerned with learning something interpretable from data, whereas machine learning has been concerned with turning data into something prac- tical and usable. This contrast makes it easier to understand the term machine learn- ing: Machine learning is concerned with teaching computers something about the world, so that they can use that knowledge to perform other tasks. In contrast, statistics is more concerned with developing tools for teaching humans something about the world, so that they can think more clearly about the world in order to make better decisions.

在机器学习中，我们要做的是通过一些解析数据结构的算法，在数据中尽可能的过滤掉噪声，提取有用的信息。由于我们需要过滤噪声获得有价值的数据，我们需要对有价值数据进行模式定义，当遇到这种模式的时候我们就知道其他数据都是没用的。所以机器学习也可以看作是一种模式识别技术。
For that reason, machine learning techniques are also referred to as pattern recognition algorithms. We can “train” our machines to learn about how data is generated in a given context, which allows us to use these algorithms to automate many useful tasks. This is where the term training set comes from, referring to the set of data used to build a machine learning process. The notion of observing data, learning from it, and then automating some process of recognition is at the heart of machine learning and forms the primary arc of this book. Two particularly important types of patterns constitute the core problems we’ll provide you with tools to solve: the problem of classification and the problem of regression, which will be introduced over the course of this book.

本书将假设读者对基本的编程技术和简单算法较为熟悉。R作为一种小众的编程语言，很多经验丰富的程序员可能也不是很熟悉，所以为了让所有读者能在同一起点，本章我们将对R做一些简单的介绍，教会读者如何使用R，在稍后的案例学习中会有更进一步的知识。

>>本书不会提供完整的R开发教程。如你所见，完整的开发教程是无法放到简单的一个章节中的，所以本章的目的是介绍一些机器学习中会用到的R开发技能，尤其是如何加载、遍历、清除和分析数据。现在有很多不错的著作专门用来讨论R语言编程、最佳实践，所以我们只会关注跟我们的案例相关的那些主题，而且不会非常深入的去探究。如果对这些主题有深入的兴趣，可以参考 Table 1-3。


If you have never seen the R language and its syntax before, we highly recommend going through this introduction to get some exposure. Unlike other high-level scripting languages, such as Python or Ruby, R has a unique and somewhat prickly syntax and tends to have a steeper learning curve than other languages. If you have used R before but not in the context of machine learning, there is still value in taking the time to go through this review before moving on to the case studies.
