第一章 使用R
=================

Machine learning exists at the intersection of traditional mathematics and statistics with software engineering and computer science. In this book, we will describe several tools from traditional statistics that allow you to make sense of the world. Statistics has almost always been concerned with learning something interpretable from data, whereas machine learning has been concerned with turning data into something prac- tical and usable. This contrast makes it easier to understand the term machine learn- ing: Machine learning is concerned with teaching computers something about the world, so that they can use that knowledge to perform other tasks. In contrast, statistics is more concerned with developing tools for teaching humans something about the world, so that they can think more clearly about the world in order to make better decisions.
In machine learning, the learning occurs by extracting as much information from the data as possible (or reasonable) through algorithms that parse the basic structure of the data and distinguish the signal from the noise. After they have found the signal, or pattern, the algorithms simply decide that everything else that’s left over is noise. For that reason, machine learning techniques are also referred to as pattern recognition algorithms. We can “train” our machines to learn about how data is generated in a given context, which allows us to use these algorithms to automate many useful tasks. This is where the term training set comes from, referring to the set of data used to build a machine learning process. The notion of observing data, learning from it, and then automating some process of recognition is at the heart of machine learning and forms the primary arc of this book. Two particularly important types of patterns constitute the core problems we’ll provide you with tools to solve: the problem of classification and the problem of regression, which will be introduced over the course of this book.
In this book, we assume a relatively high degree of knowledge in basic programming techniques and algorithmic paradigms. That said, R remains a relatively niche language, even among experienced programmers. In an effort to establish the same starting point for everyone, this chapter provides some basic information on how to get started using the R language. Later in the chapter we will provide an extended case study for working with data in R.


This chapter does not provide a complete introduction to the R pro- gramming language. As you might expect, no such introduction could fit into a single book chapter. Instead, this chapter is meant to prepare the reader for the tasks associated with doing machine learning in R, specifically the process of loading, exploring, cleaning, and analyzing data. There are many excellent resources on R that discuss language fundamentals such as data types, arithmetic concepts, and coding best practices. In so far as those topics are relevant to the case studies pre- sented here, we will touch on all of these issues; however, there will be no explicit discussion of these topics. For those interested in reviewing these topics, many of these resources are listed in Table 1-3.


If you have never seen the R language and its syntax before, we highly recommend going through this introduction to get some exposure. Unlike other high-level scripting languages, such as Python or Ruby, R has a unique and somewhat prickly syntax and tends to have a steeper learning curve than other languages. If you have used R before but not in the context of machine learning, there is still value in taking the time to go through this review before moving on to the case studies.
