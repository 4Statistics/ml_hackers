## 机器学习黑客 ##
为了更好的解释这本书是从哪个角度来写机器学习的，我们需要定义什么是机器学习黑客。

什么是机器学习？从最高概括层次上来说，**我们认为机器学习是一组工具和方法的集合**，这些工具和方法用来提取一个可观察世界里的数据，并且可以对这些数据内含的模式进行推测。比如，我们想要让计算机能够识别信封上的邮编，那么我们可能需要一组包含收件人邮编及其信封照片的数据用来分析。也就是说，在一些场景中，我们可以从要研究的目标的活动中提取一些记录，通过这些记录不断的进行学习，然后把这种学习过程创建为模型，这种模型就可以显示出机器对当前场景的理解程度。在实践中，这种过程往往需要大量的数据，尤其对于现代应用程序，可能要很多TB的数据。Most machine learning techniques take the availability of such data as given, which means new opportunities for their application in light of the quantities of data that are produced as a product of running modern companies.

什么是黑客？与那些模式化的描写为邪恶青少年或者吉普赛网络混混的主流文化不同，我们认为黑客是一个喜欢解决问题并且体验新技术的群体。如果你曾经拿着一本描写新编程语言的O'Reilly图书坐在电脑旁，如果不敲出来Hello World绝不罢休的话，那么你也是一个黑客，如果你曾经把一个机器拆的七零八落，一定要搞清楚里面的结构，那么我们认为你同样是一个黑客。这种行为的原因不外乎是想要知道“为什么”、“如何做”这些知识。

除了对事物是如何运作的天生好奇和强烈的动手欲望外，计算机黑客(当然可以是汽车黑客、生活黑客、食物黑客等等)往往拥有软件设计和开发的能力，也就是那些用不同开发语言编写程序的人。对于一个黑客来说，Unix不仅仅是四个字符，命令行和bash可以和图形化操作一样自然，正则表达式和sed、awk这些工具都是黑客的基本技能。

## 这本书是如何组织的
Machine learning blends concepts and techniques from many different traditional fields, such as mathematics, statistics, and computer science. As such, there are many ways to learn the discipline. Considering its theoretical foundations in mathematics and statistics, newcomers would do well to attain some degree of mastery of the formal specifications of basic machine learning techniques. There are many excellent books that focus on the fundamentals, the classic work being Hastie, Tibshirani, and Fried- man’s The Elements of Statistical Learning ([HTF09]; full references can be found in the Works Cited).1 But another important part of the hacker mantra is to learn by doing. Many hackers may be more comfortable thinking of problems in terms of the process by which a solution is attained, rather than the theoretical foundation from which the solution is derived.
From this perspective, an alternative approach to teaching machine learning would be to use “cookbook”-style examples. To understand how a recommendation system works, for example, we might provide sample training data and a version of the model, and show how the latter uses the former. There are many useful texts of this kind as well, and Segaran’s Programming Collective Intelligence is one recent example [Seg07]. Such a discussion would certainly address the how of a hacker’s method of learning, but perhaps less of the why. Along with understanding the mechanics of a method, we may also want to learn why it is used in a certain context or to address a specific prob- lem.
To provide a more complete reference on machine learning for hackers, therefore, we need to compromise between providing a deep review of the theoretical foundations of the discipline and a broad exploration of its applications. To accomplish this, we have decided to teach machine learning through selected case studies.
We believe the best way to learn is by first having a problem in mind, then focusing on learning the tools used to solve that problem. This is effectively the mechanism through which case studies work. The difference being, rather than having some problem for which there may be no known solution, we can focus on well-understood and studied problems in machine learning and present specific examples of cases where some sol- utions excelled while others failed spectacularly.
For that reason, each chapter of this book is a self-contained case study focusing on a specific problem in machine learning. The organization of the early cases moves from classification to regression (discussed further in Chapter 1). We then examine topics

such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and optimization. It is important to note that not all problems fit neatly into either the classification or regression categories, and some of the case studies reviewed in this book will include aspects of both (some- times explicitly, but also in more subtle ways that we will review). Following are brief descriptions of all the case studies reviewed in this book in the order they appear:
Text classification: spam detection
In this chapter we introduce the idea of binary classification, which is motivated through the use of email text data. Here we tackle the classic problem in machine learning of classifying some input as one of two types, which in this case is either ham (legitimate email) or spam (unwanted email).
Ranking items: priority inbox
Using the same email text data as in the previous case study, here we move beyond a binary classification to a discrete set of types. Specifically, we need to identify the appropriate features to extract from the email that can best inform its “priority” rank among all emails.
Regression models: predicting page views
We now introduce the second primary tool in machine learning, linear regression. Here we explore data whose relationship roughly approximates a straight line. In this case study, we are interested in predicting the number of page views for the top 1,000 websites on the Internet as of 2011.
Regularization: text regression
Sometimes the relationships in our data are not well described by a straight line. To describe the relationship, we may need to fit a different function; however, we also must be cautious not to overfit. Here we introduce the concept of regulariza- tion to overcome this problem, and motivate it through a case study, focusing on understanding the relationship among words in the text from O’Reilly book de- scriptions.
Optimization: code breaking
Moving beyond regression models, almost every algorithm in machine learning can be viewed as an optimization problem in which we try to minimize some measure of prediction error. Here we introduce classic algorithms for performing this op- timization and attempt to break a simple letter cipher with these techniques.
Unsupervised learned: building a stock market index
Up to this point we have discussed only supervised learning techniques. Here we introduce its methodological counterpart: unsupervised learning. The important difference is that in supervised learning, we wish to use the structure of our data to make predictions, whereas in unsupervised learning, we wish to discover struc- ture in our data for structure’s sake. In this case we will use stock market data to create an index that describes how well the overall market is doing.
￼￼Preface | ix
Spatial similarity: clustering US Senators by the voting records
Here we introduce the concept of spatial distances among observations. To do so, we define measures of distance and describe methods for clustering observations basing on their spatial distances. We use data from US Senator roll call voting to cluster those legislators based on their votes.
Recommendation system: suggesting R packages to users
To further the discussion of spatial similarities, we discuss how to build a recom- mendation system based on the closeness of observations in space. Here we intro- duce the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and use it to suggest R packages to pro- grammers based on their currently installed packages.
Social network analysis: who to follow on Twitter
Here we attempt to combine many of the concepts previously discussed, as well as introduce a few new ones, to design and build a “who to follow” recommendation system from Twitter data. In this case we build a system for downloading Twitter network data, discover communities within the structure, and recommend new users to follow using basic social network analysis techniques.
Model comparison: finding the best algorithm for your problem
In the final chapter, we discuss techniques for choosing which machine learning algorithm to use to solve your problem. We introduce our final algorithm, the support vector machine, and compare its performance on the spam data from Chapter 3 with the performance of the other algorithms we introduce earlier in the book.
The primary tool we use to explore these case studies is the R statistical programming language (http://www.r-project.org/). R is particularly well suited for machine learning case studies because it is a high-level, functional scripting language designed for data analysis. Much of the underlying algorithmic scaffolding required is already built into the language or has been implemented as one of the thousands of R packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).2 This will allow us to focus on the how and the why of these problems, rather than review and rewrite the foundational code for each case.
