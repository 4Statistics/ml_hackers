## Means, Medians, and Modes ##

Learning to tell means and medians apart is one of the most tedious parts of the typical “Intro to Stats” class. It can take a little while to become familiar with those concepts, but we really do believe that you’ll need to be able to tell them apart if you want to seriously work with data. In the interests of better pedagogy, we’ll try to hammer home the meaning of those terms in two pretty different ways. First, we’ll show you how to compute the mean and the median algorithmically. For most hackers, code is a more natural language to express ideas than mathematical symbols, so we think that rolling your own functions to compute means and medians will probably make more sense than showing you the defining equations for those two statistics. And later in this chapter, we’ll show you how you can tell when the mean and median are different by looking at the shape of your data in histograms and density plots.
Computing the mean is incredibly easy. In R, you would normally use the mean function. Of course, telling you to use a black-box function doesn’t convey much of the intuition for what a mean is, so let’s implement our own version of mean, which we’ll call my.mean. It’s just one line of R code because the relevant concepts are already available as two other functions in R: sum and length.
    
    my.mean <- function(x) {
    return(sum(x) / length(x)) }

That single line of code is all there is to a mean: you just add up all the numbers in your vector and then divide the sum by the length of the vector. As you’d expect, this function produces the average value of the numbers in your vector, x. The mean is so easy to compute in part because it doesn’t have anything to do with the sorted positions of the numbers in your list.
The median is just the opposite: it entirely depends upon the relative position of the numbers in your list. In R, you would normally compute the median using median, but let’s write our version, which we’ll call my.median:

    my.median <- function(x) { sorted.x <- sort(x)
    if (length(x) %% 2 == 0) {
    indices <- c(length(x) / 2, length(x) / 2 + 1)
    return(mean(sorted.x[indices])) }
    else {
    index <- ceiling(length(x) / 2)
    return(sorted.x[index]) }
    }

Just counting lines of code should tell you that the median takes a little bit more work to compute than the mean. As a first step, we had to sort the vector, because the median is essentially the number that’s in the middle of your sorted vector. That’s why the median is also called the 50th percentile or the 2nd quartile. Once you’ve sorted a vector, you can easily compute any of the other percentiles or quantiles just by splitting the list into two parts somewhere else along its length. To get the 25th percentile (also known as the 1st quartile), you can split the list at one quarter of its length.
The only problem with these informal definitions in terms of length is that they don’t exactly make sense if your list has an even number of entries. When there’s no single number that’s exactly in the middle of your data set, you need to do some trickery to produce the median. The code we wrote in the previous example handles the even-length vector case by taking the average of the two entries that would have been the median if the list had contained an odd number of entries.
To make that point clear, here is a simple example in which the median has to be invented by averaging entries and another case in which the median is exactly equal to the middle entry of the vector:

    my.vector <- c(0, 100) my.vector
    # [1] 0 100 mean(my.vector)
    #[1] 50
    median(my.vector)
    #[1] 50
    my.vector <- c(0, 0, 100) mean(my.vector)
    #[1] 33.33333 median(my.vector)
    #[1] 0

Returning to our original heights and weights data set, let’s compute the mean and median of the heights data. This will also give us an opportunity to test our code:

    my.mean(heights)
    #[1] 66.36756
    my.median(heights)
    #[1] 66.31807
    mean(heights) - my.mean(heights) #[1] 0
    median(heights) - my.median(heights) #[1] 0

The mean and median in this example are very close to each other. In a little bit, we’ll explain why we should expect that to be the case given the shape of the data we’re working with.
As we’ve just described two of the three most prominent numbers from an intro stats course, you may be wondering why we haven’t mentioned the mode. We’ll talk about modes in a bit, but there’s a reason we’ve ignored it so far: the mode, unlike the mean or median, doesn’t always have a simple definition for the kinds of vectors we’ve been working with. Because it’s not easy to automate, R doesn’t have a built-in function that will produce the mode of a vector of numbers.

>>>It’s complicated to define the mode of an arbitrary vector because you need the numbers in the vector to repeat if you’re going to define the mode numerically. When the numbers in a vector could be arbitrary floating-point values, it’s unlikely that any single numeric value would ever be repeated in the vector. For that reason, modes are only really defined visually for many kinds of data sets.

All that said, if you’re still not sure about the math and are wondering what the mode should be in theory, it’s supposed to be the number that occurs most often in your data set.
